      <article><h3>My name is Daniel, and I majored at UWT with a bachelors in social work.
        It seems to be oddly placed that I wanted to start studying programming
        when my major is so far different from it, but there are reasons why I
        decided to enroll. I always enjoyed creating things and using computers
        ever since I was a little kid. I feel like I have a mind for solving
        problems, just like I try doing in my job. I always enjoyed the paperwork
        side of my job better anyway. Aside from this, I am also just tired of
        being broke - because the social work field does not pay much or offer
        benefits that I would ever want to be a breadwinner with. After elevating
        my career to something that utilizes computer skills in it, the next
        problem I will run into is how to stop being single. But that's not some
        thing I need to get into right now.</h3></article>
        <h4>Some other things I enjoy are:</h4>
        <h5>Star Wars (the not the recent ones).
        Halo (but not as much the recent ones).
      Mass Effect (also not so much the recent one...)</h5>
        <h6>I love the Lord of the Rings, and I even like the new Hobbit movies despite
  the major differences they have from the books...</h6>
